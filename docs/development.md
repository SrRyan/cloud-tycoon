# Development

## Setting Up

* Clone this repo
* Run `yarn` to install dependencies
* Run `yarn dev` to run the application

## Adding Assets

Assets must be added to the boot scene `loadAssets()` function to be used throughout the game.

### Attributions

Some things we will need to attribute (if we keep the assets):

* Sounds from ZapSplat.com (main menu song)
