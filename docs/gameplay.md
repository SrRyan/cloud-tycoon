# Gameplay

This document is a basic overview of the different elements of gameplay. The goal of this game is to [complete all the levels, I guess?]. During each level, you must earn a specific amount of monthly reoccurring cash (revenue - costs) to be able to progress to the next level and access larger facilities. At some point the game will be over because you have 100% market share or because the only place to expand is into space. Perhaps that's Cloud Tycoon V.2.

## MVP

The MVP of this game is to get a level one built, which takes place in a garage. At level one, we are only offering one facility (your garage), one product (app hosting), one customer level (small businesses), and a limited shop. Additional gameplay elements can be added if time still remains after level one is completed.

## GamePlay Elements

### Time

The game is measured in months from year 0, month 1. Each month is 2 minutes of game time, which can be paused or sped up.

### Events

Each month a random event can occur, based on the combination of the likelihood of that event occurring and the items that have been purchased to prevent or mitigate that event. That event can impact 1) the number of customers or 2) money.

### Shop

A shop exists where users can purchase additional servers or other items, such as ones that can mitigate certain events (ex., a fire protection system to minimize the impact of fires, or a UPS to mitigate the impacts of short power outages).

### Products

The player has specific products that are offered, such as web hosting of applications, and they set the price of those products. There is a market average and market standard deviation which can be compared to the set price to either cause customers to leave (if prices are too high) or cause more customers to join (if prices are too low). If the user changes prices too frequently then there is negative sentiment from customers that results in customers leaving more frequently.

### Customers

There are several different tiers of customers which have varying numbers of apps that they want to host. Customers have different loyalty numbers, where smaller businesses are less likely to switch services and larger customers are more likely to switch services. Customers joining and leaving can also be impacted by other things, such as the price of products and specific events.

### Facilities

There are different facility options at each level. Each facility has a maximum number of servers that can be hosted there.

### Research

There are different research trees available at each level. Developers can be hired to research each item, expanding the product offering for the company. There is not a 1:1 relationship between developers and months to complete a research item, and the player is responsible for assigning different numbers of developers to each project.

### Employees

Players are responsible for hiring and firing employees. To keep things simple for now, employees all have the same salary and stay indefinitely, unless they are fired. Players are also responsible for assigning X number of employees to each research project, which has an impact on the timeline of the completion of that project.
