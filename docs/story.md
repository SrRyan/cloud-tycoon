# Story

## Intro

The year is 2013, you have recently started self-hosting your favorite game, SphereCraft, and have some extra space on your rig to spare. You have an idea to offer server space to others to make some extra cash (which would be nice, as you are currently crashing in your parents' basement).

## Level 1

|Location|Funding Needed|Monthly Cost|Max Servers|Max Employees|
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
|Parents' basement|$0|$0|5|1 (you)|

### Possible events

- Power outage
- Fire
- Faulty equipment
- DDoS

### Background

You have started a site to offer space on your server for folks looking to host various applications. You start out with three basic offerings:

- Basic VM
- Advanced VM (higher CPU/memory)
- Hosted MySQL

Fortunately, you don't need to pay rent at your parents' place, but you _do_ need to contribute to the electric bill you've been driving up with your venture. This will cost you [INSERT PRICE PER SERVER PER MONTH]. You should probably set a competitive price that still allows you to cover your part of the electric bill.

As you gain customers and start earning money, you'll have the opportunity to purchase more servers. As you add more servers, you can start doing research into more offerings for your new business! As its just you, though, research can take a while.

There will come a point when you make enough money that you can start looking into relocating to a new facility...

## Level 2

|Location|Funding Needed|Monthly Cost|Max Servers|Max Employees|
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
|Warehouse|$10,000|$700|100|20|

### Possible events

- Power outage
- Fire
- Faulty equipment
- DDoS
- Rodent infestation
- Data breach
- Natural disaster

### Background

Moving on up in the world! You now have moved into a warehouse that has much more room to add more servers and gives you the opportunity to staff your growing business. With more people comes the ability to purchase better hardware and speed up the time it takes to do research. However, all of this does come at a cost... literally. You will have to pay rent and the salaries of anyone you employ.

## Level 3

|Location|Funding Needed|Monthly Cost|Max Servers|Max Employees|
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
|us-east-1|$100,000|$5,000|5,000|1000|

### Possible events

- Power outage
- Fire
- Faulty equipment
- DDoS
- Rodent infestation
- Data breach
- Natural disaster
- Disgruntled employee sues (depends on if any employees were fired)
- Global pandemic

### Background

Can you say Availability Zones? You now have a cluster of dedicated data centers across Northern Virginia! This affords redundancy and more employees, but it sure is expensive. Taking advantage of disaster recovery options should give you an edge in the growing cloud space. Certain events won't affect you as much the more you invest in service resilience.

## Level 4

|Location|Funding Needed|Monthly Cost|Max Servers|Max Employees|
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
|us-west-1|$500,000|$10,000|10,000|2,000|

### Possible events

- Power outage
- Fire
- Faulty equipment
- DDoS
- Rodent infestation
- Data breach
- Natural disaster
- Disgruntled employee sues (depends on if any employees were fired)
- Global pandemic
- Supply chain issues
- Labor shortage

### Background

Now that you are multi-region, you are getting more recognition in the cloud space. More recognition comes with more customers, but also more visibility whenever something goes wrong. You are now able to add new datacenters to your regions for more resiliency, though keep in mind that this could affect customer perception if you create too many too soon.

## Level 4

|Location|Funding Needed|Monthly Cost|Max Servers|Max Employees|
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
|eu-central-1|$1,000,000|$100,000|100,000|20,000|

### Possible events

- Power outage
- Fire
- Faulty equipment
- DDoS
- Rodent infestation
- Data breach
- Natural disaster
- Disgruntled employee sues (depends on if any employees were fired)
- Global pandemic
- Supply chain issues
- Labor shortage
- Anti-trust lawsuit
- EPA rallies against you

### Background

Mr. Worldwide! You are on top of the game in the cloud space and have started to build out facilities "across the pond" as they say (or, they seem to say). Can you keep your company in tact as your business starts to gain the attention of the government and environmental protection agencies? You have many options for growing your business in an ethical way, though it does come at a price.
